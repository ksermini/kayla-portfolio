      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>
        I’m Kayla — a systems-focused data engineer building modular, production-grade ETL frameworks and pipelines. 
        I lead CI/CD transformations, design clean architecture, and bring a human-first approach to everything I code.
      </p>
      <p>
        I grew up with my dad by my side — a dev turned architect — who taught me SOLID principles before I even knew what `OOP` meant. 
        That mindset stuck. Today, I’m scaling a low-code ETL platform and refining DevOps pipelines with Azure — and I still love learning as much as building.
