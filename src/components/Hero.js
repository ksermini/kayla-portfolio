    title: "CI/CD: Why consistency beats chaos",
    blurb: "From semantic versioning to Azure DevOps, Iâ€™ve built pipelines that donâ€™t just deploy code â€” they build confidence.",
    full: "I introduced CI/CD pipelines across 5 stacks, integrating semantic versioning, automated testing, and branching strategies. It cut release delays and empowered teams to ship reliably without firefighting. CI/CD isn't just automation â€” it's discipline at scale.",
    tech: ["Azure DevOps", "PowerShell", "Python"],
  },
  {
    title: "Low Code / No Code: Scaling without hand-coding",
    blurb: "I architected a low-code ETL framework that eliminated repetitive scripting while keeping full flexibility.",
    full: "With metadata-driven YAML configs, dynamic class loading, and modular validation rules, my framework lets teams onboard sources without touching the core logic. No more copy-paste engineering. Just pure speed, clarity, and reusability.",
    tech: ["Python", "YAML", "SQLAlchemy"],
  },
  {
    title: "PowerShell: My unlikely favorite tool",
    blurb: "It's not flashy, but it gets the job done. PowerShell became my go-to for CI/CD scripting and automation.",
    full: "I used PowerShell to script semantic versioning, automate deployments, and set up dynamic handshakes between systems. Itâ€™s a perfect example of choosing the right tool for the job â€” simple, scriptable, powerful.",
    tech: ["PowerShell", "GitHub Actions"],
  },
  {
    title: "SDLC: The system that runs the system",
    blurb: "I live and breathe clean architecture â€” because clean processes produce clean code.",
    full: "I standardize SDLC practices across teams by embedding documentation-first thinking, branch strategies, and peer reviews. I love the clarity of a defined process and how it brings teams together toward consistent quality.",
