# Kayla's Portfolio

This is the code behind my personal portfolio site. It’s where I showcase my work—but also how I think as a developer. I didn’t just want it to *look* clean; I built it to be fast, accessible, and easy to maintain like a production app, even if it’s just for me.

## Built With

- **React + Vite** for speed and modularity  
- **Tailwind CSS** to stay efficient with styling  
- **React Router** for page transitions  
- **GitHub Pages** for simple, no-fuss deployment  
- **ESLint + Prettier + Husky** to keep the codebase tidy  

## What Makes This Site Different

- **Component-based layout**  
  Everything’s broken into small, focused components. Easy to update, reuse, or replace without breaking anything else.

- **Instant dev feedback**  
  Vite’s hot reload is ridiculously fast. Makes building and testing changes feel frictionless.

- **Fully responsive**  
  Built mobile-first, with clean breakpoints and flexible layouts that hold up across devices.

- **Accessible and semantic**  
  ARIA tags and semantic HTML are baked in. I wanted this site to be usable for everyone, not just visually polished.

- **No dark mode... yet**  
  It’s something I’ve been meaning to build in. I’m thinking Tailwind’s `dark:` classes or a custom toggle with `localStorage` support could do the trick.

## Why This Matters (Especially if You Manage Engineers)

I treated this like a real-world app:

- **It’s scalable.** The structure can grow with more content or features without becoming a mess.  
- **It’s maintainable.** Clear file naming, scoped components, and helpful tooling make it easy to pick up or hand off.  
- **It’s clean.** Pre-push hooks, linters, and formatters run automatically so bad code doesn’t make it in.  

## What’s Next

This is a living project. I plan to experiment with:

- Automated Lighthouse performance reports  
- A backend for the contact form (probably Supabase or Firebase)  
- Animations and transitions using Framer Motion
